    <p> The common kingfisher is a small, brightly coloured bird with a large head and short tail1. It is often spotted as a flash of metallic blue as it hunts over rivers and streams. The bird has a stout body, large head, and a broad, pointed bill. It is a fearsome predator and will tackle fish much larger and heavier than itself, diving at lightning speed headfirst into the water to catch its prey.</p>
